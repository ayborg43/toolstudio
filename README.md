## 🚀 What is Azela Studio?

Hey there! 👋 Azela Studio is an open-source web application I built to make working with JSON and XML data more enjoyable and productive. As a developer, I found myself constantly switching between different tools for parsing, visualizing, and converting data formats - so I decided to build one tool that does it all, with a clean, modern interface.

Whether you're debugging API responses, analyzing configuration files, or converting between data formats, Azela Studio has you covered. Everything runs locally in your browser - your data never leaves your computer.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 JSON Studio
- **Smart Parsing**: Real-time JSON validation with helpful error messages
- **Tree Visualization**: Interactive tree view with search and navigation
- **D3 Visualizer**: Beautiful hierarchical visualizations of complex data structures
- **Formatting Tools**: One-click pretty printing and minification
- **Statistics**: Detailed analysis of your JSON structure (size, depth, key count)

### 📝 XML Architect
- **XML Formatting**: Clean, readable XML formatting with proper indentation
- **Validation**: Basic XML structure validation
- **JSON Conversion**: Convert XML to JSON with a single click
- **Minification**: Remove unnecessary whitespace for production use

### 🎨 User Experience
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, dark/light theme with smooth animations
- **Keyboard Friendly**: Designed for power users who love keyboard shortcuts
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop and tablet
- **Performance First**: Optimized for handling large data files efficiently

## 🚦 Quick Start

Getting started with Azela Studio is super simple:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/azela-studio.git
cd azela-studio

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev

# 4. Open your browser and visit:
# http://localhost:3000
```

That's it! You should see Azela Studio running in your browser. No API keys, no configuration, just pure data tooling goodness.

## 🛠️ Development

I built Azela Studio with modern web technologies that I love working with:

- **React 19** with TypeScript for type-safe components
- **Vite** for lightning-fast development and builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **D3.js** for data visualizations
- **ES Modules** for modern JavaScript

## 📋 Roadmap

Here's what I'm thinking about for future versions:

- [ ] **YAML Support**: Full YAML parsing and conversion
- [ ] **JSON Schema**: Validate JSON against schemas
- [ ] **Diff Tool**: Compare two JSON/XML documents
